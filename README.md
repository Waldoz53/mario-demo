# mario-demo

Currently just a demo for animations, level building and very limited AI

Some bugs exist such as goombas getting stuck in pipes or walls

There is no end screen (yet?)

All art except for the player was done by me in Paint

Sprite art is taken from https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero

Playable at https://waldoz53.github.io/mario-demo/index.html
